# Sticky Notes

**A sticky notes app for Linux (yes, for Linux too!) and macOS that doesn't look like it escaped from a 2006 GNOME panel.**

## Why this exists

For ten years I've been looking for a sticky notes app for Ubuntu that I could actually stand to look at.

Every one I tried fell into one of two camps:

- **Pretty but useless.** Beautiful rounded corners, lovely typography, three features — one of which is "change the color of the note."
- **Useful but ugly.** Tabs! Folders! Tags! Wiki-links! Markdown! Rendered in fonts last updated when Firefox had a phoenix logo.

I wanted both. I couldn't find it. So I built it in a day with [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/) and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

This is that app. It runs on **Linux, macOS, and in the browser**.

## Screenshots

**Your whole desk, at a glance.** Pan, zoom, and drop notes wherever they feel right. Link two notes by clicking the link icon on one and then the other — connections show up as dashed arrows on the canvas.

**Folders that aren't an afterthought.** Colored folder badges, per-folder note counts, and a drawer that actually gets out of the way when you want it to.

**Six looks — because a 2pm notes session and a 2am notes session are not the same notes session.**

Paper is the default. Flat if you want something quieter. Terminal if you've made peace with what you are. Then three for the dark: Tokyo, Nord, and Dracula.

**Close up.** Markdown body, link arrows, color-coded folder badges. Click the red pushpin in a note's header — pinned notes follow you into every folder, so the important stuff is always one click away.

**Notes that nudge you.** Right-click any note and set a reminder — every 5 minutes, every hour, or any interval you type. Your desktop shows it as an ordinary notification, titled with the note and bodied with its text. A bell in the note's header says one is running; click it to change the interval or switch it off. Reminders run while Sticky Notes is open, and stop the moment you turn one off or delete the note.

## What it does *not* do

- Sync to the cloud. (I may add this. I also may not.)
- Collaborate in real time. These are sticky notes.
- Nag you when the app is closed. Reminders need Sticky Notes running — there is no background daemon and no tray icon.
- Parse your notes with a large language model to surface insights. **These are sticky notes.**

## Design principles

A short list, because the whole point of this project is that somebody should have written one:

1. **It should be pleasant to open.** If the app is ugly, I won't use it, and then none of the features matter.
2. **Features should earn their place.** Every toolbar button is a small betrayal of the reader's attention.
3. **The canvas is the interface.** Not a sidebar. Not a list. The notes, where you put them.
4. **Escape hatches everywhere.** Keyboard shortcut for the common things. Drag-and-drop for everything. Your notes are a JSON file you can read with `cat`.

## Install

### Pre-built downloads (recommended)

Easiest path on Ubuntu — install from the Snap Store, auto-updates included:

```bash
sudo snap install sticky-notes-canvas
```

Or grab the latest from [**Releases**](https://github.com/faridjaff/StickyNotesCanvas/releases/latest) and pick the file for your platform:

| Platform | File | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| **Ubuntu / any distro with snapd** | (Snap Store) | `sudo snap install sticky-notes-canvas` |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | `sticky-notes-canvas_<ver>_amd64.deb` | `sudo dpkg -i sticky-notes-canvas_<ver>_amd64.deb` |
| **Linux (portable)** | `Sticky Notes-<ver>.AppImage` | `chmod +x` and double-click — no install needed |
| **macOS — via Homebrew** | (tap) | `brew install --cask faridjaff/tap/sticky-notes-canvas` |
| **macOS — Apple Silicon (M-series)** | `Sticky Notes-<ver>-arm64.dmg` | mount → drag to `/Applications` |
| **macOS — Intel** | `Sticky Notes-<ver>.dmg` | mount → drag to `/Applications` |

#### Note for macOS

The macOS builds are not code-signed. If your Mac refuses to open the downloaded app, build from source instead — instructions below.

### Web (no install)

Hosted version: <https://faridjaff.github.io/StickyNotesCanvas/>. Each visitor's notes live in their own browser's `localStorage` — separate from any other browser, separate from the desktop app. Survives refresh; cleared if you wipe site data.

---

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**
- **macOS only:** Xcode Command Line Tools — `xcode-select --install`
- **Linux only:** nothing extra; `electron-builder` fetches `fpm` (for `.deb` packaging) on first build

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:faridjaff/StickyNotesCanvas.git
cd sticky-notes-canvas
npm install
```

### Build and install

#### Linux

```bash
npm run build:linux
sudo dpkg -i "dist/sticky-notes-canvas_$(node -p 'require(\"./package.json\").version')_amd64.deb"
```

The app appears in your Activities menu as **Sticky Notes**. To uninstall later: `sudo apt remove sticky-notes-canvas`.

#### macOS

```bash
npm run build:mac
cp -R "dist/mac-arm64/Sticky Notes.app" /Applications/
```

(Use `dist/mac/Sticky Notes.app` instead if you're on an Intel Mac.)

Launch from Spotlight (`Cmd+Space` → "Sticky Notes") or from Launchpad. To uninstall later, drag the app from `/Applications` to the Trash.

---

## Where your notes live

| | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.config/sticky-notes-canvas/notes.json` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/sticky-notes-canvas/notes.json` |
| Browser | `localStorage` key `stickies.all` |

The JSON format is identical across all three — copy the file from one machine to another and your notes come with it.
